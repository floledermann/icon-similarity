# Similarity Analysis of SVG Icons

## Usage

To use the tool, access index.html through a web server. You can run a web server in the project directory as follows:

Python
```
python -m http.server 8089
```

Node.js
```
npx http-server -p 8089
```

and then visit http://localhost:8089 in your browser.

For Windows users, the enclosed `serve.bat` launches a Node.js web server. 

After launching the tool, drop a set of svg files onto the provided area. The results of the analysis are output in the browser window and can be copied to a file for subsequent analysis.
